* PostgreSQL with Automated Encrypted Backups

Sets up PostgreSQL with automated, encrypted backups to remote storage using Rclone and Age.

** Features

- PostgreSQL Database (with pg_vector extension)
- Automated daily backups (configurable)
- Client-side encryption via Age
- Uploads via Rclone to configured remote storage
- Only uploads if data has changed
- Retains backups for a configurable number of days
- DB can be connected from host or another container
- Optional: Telegram notifications when backups fail

** Quick Setup

1. *Create =.env= file:* Create a file named =.env= in the project root with the following (replace placeholders):
   #+begin_src conf
   # --- PostgreSQL ---
   POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
   POSTGRES_DB=your_initial_db

   # --- Backup ---
   # Generate with: cat ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf | base64 -w 0
   RCLONE_CONFIG_BASE64="PASTE_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_RCLONE_CONFIG_HERE"
   # Your Age public key (starts with 'age1...')
   AGE_PUBLIC_KEY="age1..."
   # Rclone remote path (e.g., "my_remote:my_postgres_backups")
   REMOTE_PATH="your_rclone_remote:path/to/backups"
   # Optional: Container timezone (e.g., "UTC", "America/New_York")
   TZ=UTC
   # Optional: Telegram notifications
   # TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
   # TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
   #+end_src

2. *(Optional) Customize PostgreSQL:* Place your =postgresql.conf= and =pg_hba.conf= in the =pg_config/= directory.

3. *Start PostgreSQL:* Run =sudo docker compose up --build -d= to start PostgreSQL and automated backups.

** Accessing the Database

*** Accessing from Host (CLI)

- Connect using a client (e.g., =psql=) to =localhost:5432= (or the mapped port specified in =docker-compose.yml=).
- Use the =POSTGRES_USER= and =POSTGRES_PASSWORD= from your =.env= file.
  #+begin_src bash
  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U your_db_user -d your_initial_db
  #+end_src

*** Accessing from Host (Adminer)

Adminer is a lightweight database management tool. You can run it as a separate Docker container.

*Open Adminer:* Navigate to =http://localhost:8080= in your web browser.

*** Accessing from Another Container (Shared Network)

If you have another application running in a Docker container and want it to connect to this PostgreSQL database, ensure both containers are on the same Docker network.

#+begin_src yaml
  # --- Example: Another application container's docker-compose.yaml ---
  services:
    my_app:
      image: your_app_image
      restart: always
      environment:
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postgres_user:password@pg_with_backup:5432/app_database"
      networks:
        - shared_net
  networks:
    shared_net:
      external: true
      name: pg_shared_network # use the same network as the PostgreSQL container
#+end_src

** Logs

- View PostgreSQL and backup logs:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo docker-compose logs -f pg_with_backup
#+end_src


** Restore

1. Download the =.sql.gz.age= backup file from your Rclone remote.
2. Decrypt: =age -d -i /path/to/private.key backup.sql.gz.age > backup.sql.gz=
3. Unzip: =gunzip backup.sql.gz=
4. Restore: =psql -h localhost -U your_db_user -d your_target_db < backup.sql=
