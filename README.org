* PostgreSQL with Automated Encrypted Backups

Sets up PostgreSQL with automated, encrypted backups to remote storage using Rclone and Age.

** Features

- PostgreSQL Database (version 17 with pg_vector extension)
- Automated daily backups (configurable)
- Client-side encryption via Age
- Uploads via Rclone to configured remote storage
- Only uploads if data has changed
- Retains backups for a configurable number of days
- DB can be connected from host or another container
- Optional: Telegram notifications when backups fail

** Quick Setup

1. *Create .env file:* Modify =env_sample= in the project root and save it as =.env=.

2. *Start PostgreSQL:* Run =sudo docker compose up --build -d= to start PostgreSQL and automated backups.

3. *(Optional) Test Backup:* Run =sudo docker compose logs backup -f= to check the backup process.

** Accessing the Database

*** Accessing from Host (CLI)

- Connect using a client (e.g., =psql=) to =localhost:5432= (or the mapped port specified in =docker-compose.yml=).
- Use the =POSTGRES_USER= and =POSTGRES_PASSWORD= from your =.env= file.

#+begin_src sh
  psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U your_db_user -d your_initial_db
#+end_src

*** Accessing from Host (pgAdmin)

pgAdmin is a web-based database administration tool with a modern interface. You can access it through your browser.

*Open pgAdmin:* Navigate to =http://localhost:8080= in your web browser.

*** Accessing from Another Container (Shared Network)

If you have another application running in a Docker container and want it to connect to this PostgreSQL database, ensure both containers are on the same Docker network.

#+begin_src yaml
  # --- Example: Another application container's docker-compose.yaml ---
  services:
    my_app:
      image: your_app_image
      restart: always
      environment:
        DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://pg_user:pg_password@postgres:5432/app_database"
      networks:
        - shared_net
  networks:
    shared_net:
      external: true
      name: postgres-network # use the same network as the PostgreSQL container
#+end_src

** Restore

1. Download the =.sql.gz.age= backup file from your Rclone remote.
2. Decrypt: =age -d -i /path/to/private.key backup.sql.gz.age > backup.sql.gz=
3. Unzip: =gunzip backup.sql.gz=
4. Restore: =psql -h localhost -U your_db_user -d your_target_db < backup.sql=
