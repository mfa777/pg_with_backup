# WAL-G Cleanup Issue Fix

## Issue Description

When running `wal-g delete retain FULL N`, the cleanup command was reporting "No backup found for deletion" even though there were old backups and WAL files in the remote storage that exceeded the configured retention period.

### User Configuration
```bash
WALG_RETENTION_FULL=7
WALG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

### Problem
- The script only used `wal-g delete retain FULL N` which counts **full backups only**
- With `WALG_DELTA_MAX_STEPS=7`, most backups were delta/incremental backups, not full backups
- If there were fewer than N full backups, nothing got deleted
- The `WALG_RETENTION_DAYS` setting was not being used at all
- WAL files from September 20 (over 30 days old) were not being cleaned up

## Root Cause

The `run_cleanup()` function in `scripts/wal-g-runner.sh` only implemented count-based retention using `wal-g delete retain FULL N`, which:
1. Only counts FULL backups, ignoring delta backups
2. Doesn't consider the age of backups
3. Only deletes backups if there are more than N full backups
4. WAL files are only cleaned up when their associated base backups are deleted

## Solution

Enhanced the cleanup function to support both count-based AND time-based retention:

### 1. Time-Based Retention (New)
When `WALG_RETENTION_DAYS` is set:
- Calculate the cutoff date (N days ago from now)
- List all backups and parse their timestamps from backup names (format: `base_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`)
- Find the first backup after the cutoff date (boundary backup)
- Use `wal-g delete before BACKUP_NAME` to delete all backups (and associated WAL files) older than the cutoff
- Safety feature: Never delete all backups - always keep at least the newest one

### 2. Count-Based Retention (Existing)
After time-based cleanup, still run the count-based retention:
- Use `wal-g delete retain FULL N` to ensure at least N full backups are always kept
- This provides a safety net regardless of backup age

### 3. Dual Policy Approach
Both policies work together:
- Backups are **kept** if they meet **EITHER** condition (count OR age)
- This ensures safety: you'll always have at least N backups, but old backups beyond the retention period will be deleted if more than N exist
- Example: With `FULL=7` and `DAYS=30`, you'll have at least 7 backups, but backups older than 30 days will be deleted if you have more than 7

## Changes Made

### 1. scripts/wal-g-runner.sh
- Modified `run_cleanup()` function to support time-based retention
- Added logic to parse backup names and extract timestamps
- Added support for `wal-g delete before BACKUP_NAME` command
- Improved logging to show which backups are being deleted and why
- Changed return behavior to treat "no backups to delete" as success (not error)

### 2. scripts/mock-wal-g.sh
- Added `delete_before_backup()` function to support `delete before` command
- Enhanced `delete_old_backups()` to return proper "No backup found for deletion" message
- Updated command parsing to handle both `retain` and `before` subcommands

### 3. env_sample
- Added detailed documentation explaining how both retention policies work
- Clarified that both policies work together (OR logic)
- Provided examples of how the dual retention works

## Testing

Created test scripts to validate:
1. Backup name parsing and timestamp extraction
2. Date calculation for 30-day retention period
3. Mock wal-g `delete before` functionality
4. Both retention policies working together

### Test Results
✓ Backup from September 20, 2024 is correctly identified as 406 days old
✓ Mock wal-g correctly deletes backups before a specified backup
✓ Mock wal-g correctly handles count-based retention
✓ Both policies can run sequentially without conflicts

## Usage

### Enable Time-Based Retention
In your `.env` file:
```bash
# Keep at least 7 full backups
WALG_RETENTION_FULL=7

# Delete backups older than 30 days (if more than 7 backups exist)
WALG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

### Run Cleanup
```bash
# Manual cleanup
sudo docker compose exec backup bash -c "/opt/walg/scripts/wal-g-runner.sh clean"

# Or via cron (automatic)
# Cleanup runs based on WALG_CLEAN_CRON setting in .env
```

### Expected Output
```

```

## Benefits

1. **Solves the original problem**: Old WAL files and backups are now deleted based on age
2. **Backwards compatible**: Works with existing count-based retention
3. **Safety first**: Always keeps at least N backups, regardless of age
4. **Flexible**: Both policies can be used independently or together
5. **Clear logging**: Shows exactly what's being deleted and why
6. **No breaking changes**: Existing users with only `WALG_RETENTION_FULL` continue to work as before

## Migration Guide

Existing users:
- No action required if you only want count-based retention
- To add time-based retention, simply set `WALG_RETENTION_DAYS` in your `.env` file
- Both policies will work together automatically

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. Add support for `wal-g delete obsolete-wal` to clean up unreferenced WAL files
2. Add option to choose AND vs OR logic for dual policies
3. Add dry-run mode to preview what would be deleted
4. Add metrics/reporting for deleted backups and space reclaimed
