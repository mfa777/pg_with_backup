# Project Cleanup & Refactor Plan

This document tracks the gradual removal / consolidation of duplicated or legacy files. Phase 1 only annotates deprecations (no breaking deletions). Phase 2 will remove deprecated assets after stability is confirmed.

## Goals
- Single clear path for running either SQL or WAL-G backup modes
- Reduce file duplication (compose + dockerfiles + entrypoints)
- Provide authoritative environment variable reference
- Keep tests green during transition

## Phases

### Phase 1 (current)
Status: IN PROGRESS
- Keep all files; mark deprecated ones with a header comment.
- Introduce this `CLEANUP.md` document.
- Clarify which Dockerfile / entrypoint is the unified one.

### Phase 2 (after validation)
Pending successful test cycles and user confirmation:
- Remove deprecated files (see table below)
- Update README / docs to drop legacy references
- Optionally rename unified Dockerfiles for clarity

## File Status Table
| File | Status | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| docker-compose.yml | Active | Keep | Primary compose file |
| docker-compose.yml.backup | Deprecated | Remove in Phase 2 | Duplicate of main with trivial diffs |
| Dockerfile | Deprecated (SQL-only) | Remove or rename `Dockerfile.sql.legacy` | Replaced by multi-mode `Dockerfile.backup` |
| Dockerfile.backup | Active | Keep | Unified backup image (SQL + WAL cron logic) |
| Dockerfile.backup.simple | Deprecated | Remove | Early experimental Ubuntu variant |
| Dockerfile.postgres-walg | Active (WAL mode) | Keep | Builds postgres with wal-g + pgvector |
| entrypoint.sh | Deprecated | Remove in Phase 2 | Simpler cron-only; superseded by `entrypoint-backup.sh` |
| entrypoint-backup.sh | Active | Keep | Handles mode switch SQL/WAL for backup container |
| scripts/docker-entrypoint-walg.sh | Active | Keep | Postgres-side WAL archiving support |
| backup.sh | Active (SQL mode) | Keep | Full dump + rclone + age |
| scripts/walg-env-prepare.sh | Active | Keep | Prepares SSH + env for wal-g |
| scripts/wal-g-runner.sh | Active | Keep | Base backup / clean orchestration |
| scripts/mock-wal-g.sh & scripts/mock-wal-g | Active (tests) | Keep | Offline test support |
| .env.simple | Deprecated | Remove | Minimal legacy variant |

## Environment Variable Consolidation
Primary variables (authoritative): See `env_sample` for description.
Deprecated / Duplicate notions:
- `WALG_SSH_PORT`: Prefer `SSH_PORT` (still read legacy if exported)
- `BACKUP_VOLUME_MODE`: Only needed when externally mounting in WAL mode; not used inside logic directly.

## Migration Notes
1. Use only `docker-compose.yml` going forward.
2. For WAL mode set in `.env`:
   ```bash
   BACKUP_MODE=wal
   POSTGRES_DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.postgres-walg
   ```
3. For SQL mode set:
   ```bash
   BACKUP_MODE=sql
   # (optional) comment out POSTGRES_DOCKERFILE to use upstream base image
   ```

## Planned Deletions (Phase 2)
```
docker-compose.yml.backup
Dockerfile
Dockerfile.backup.simple
entrypoint.sh
.env.simple
```

## Risk Mitigation
- Tests still invoke only active paths.
- No behavioral change in this phaseâ€”only annotations.
- WAL-G defaults (LOG_LEVEL=DEVEL) preserved; production users should override to INFO or WARNING.

## Next Steps Checklist
- [x] Annotate deprecated files
- [ ] Run test suite after annotation
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Phase 2 deletion PR
